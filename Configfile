# Configuration of the boost library
# The boost library (see www.boost.org) is precondition for the Blaze library and the
# Blaze test scenarios, i.e., it is not possible to create any example executable without
# boost. Blaze requires you to have at least the boost version 1.39.0 or higher installed
# on your system. In case the boost include directory is not set, it is assumed that the
# boost headers are installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/boost').
# Additionally, it is necessary to specify the library path of the boost libraries and
# the name of the boost system and thread libraries (as for instance 'boost_thread-mt').
# In case the library path is not specified, it is assumed that the libraries are installed
# in standard paths (for example '/usr/lib/' or '/usr/lib64/'). If the name of the system
# library is not specified it is assumed that the library is called 'libboost_system.*'.
# If the name of the thread library is not specified it is assumed that the library is
# called 'libboost_system.*'.

# The Blaze as well as the MTL library offer the possibilty to use a BLAS library for
# certain linear algebra operations (such as for instance matrix-matrix multiplications).
# If the BLAS switch is set to 'yes', both libraries will use BLAS functions accordingly.
# Note that in case Blaze is configured to use a BLAS library, it is mandatory to also
# configure the BLAS library for the test scenarios. If BLAS is activated, per default
# it is assumed that the BLAS include file is called 'cblas.h' and is installed in
# standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/cblas.h'). Both default settings can be
# changed by explicitly specifying the BLAS include path and the name of the BLAS include
# file. Additionally, the BLAS library path has to be specified (otherwise it is assumed
# that the library resides in standard paths) and the BLAS libraries have to be specified
# (for example '-lf77blas -lcblas -latlas' for the ATLAS library). If the BLAS switch is
# set to 'no', the Blaze and the MTL libraries use their default implementations of the
# according operations.

# Configuration of the Blitz++ library (optional)
# With this setting it is possible to include the Blitz++ expression template library
# to the test scenarios. If the switch is set to 'yes' the Blitz++ library is included
# in the compilation process. In case the Blitz++ include directory is not set, Blaze
# expects the according headers in the subdirectory 'blitz' in standard paths (for

# Configuration of the GMM++ library (optional)

# Configuration of the MTL library (optional)

# Configuration of the Eigen library (optional)
